This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrect handling of null values. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  Null values are often overlooked, leading to unexpected behavior or runtime errors if not properly managed.  Always explicitly check for null values using strict equality (===) before performing operations on parameters or variables that might be null.
